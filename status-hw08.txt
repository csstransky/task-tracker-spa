Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?
Cristian Stransky


2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?
https://github.com/csstransky/task-tracker-spa


3. What's the version number of your github release?
v1.0


4. What's the URL that you deployed to?
hw09.cstransky.com


5. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?
I managed to get everything done, except when you actually create a user or task, 
the page does not go back to the root, meaning that when you hit "Create Task", the 
button will show it being indented, and an actual Task will be created, but there's 
not page movement or anything to indicate to the user that a task has been made.

It does make users and tasks though!


6. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?
Yes.
